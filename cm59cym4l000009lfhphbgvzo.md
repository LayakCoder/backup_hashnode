Creating visually appealing and functional elements is essential in web design. One such element is the checkbox, which can often look basic and uninviting. However, with a few lines of HTML, CSS, and a touch of creativity, you can turn your regular checkbox into a stylish and interactive design that enhances the user experience. In this article, we'll discuss how to create an elegant checkbox using HTML tick mark code, which includes detailed steps for customizing the checkbox with an HTML tick symbol, tick mark, and a neat interactive animation.

## Introduction to Stylish Checkboxes

Checkboxes are essential elements in many web forms. From simple preference selections to more complex surveys, a checkbox is a straightforward way to let users select an option. However, the default look of checkboxes can be quite plain. Fortunately, with the power of HTML and CSS, you can elevate this simple design element into something more attractive and engaging.

### What is HTML Tick Mark Code?

The term [**HTML tick mark code**](https://layakcoder.com/tick-mark/) refers to the combination of HTML and CSS that allows you to display a checkmark or a tick symbol inside a checkbox. Using this method, you can easily integrate an attractive tick icon into your web pages. Whether youâ€™re looking to enhance the appearance of your checkboxes or add interactive behavior, the **HTML tick symbol** can make all the difference.

In this article, we will explore the HTML tick mark code in detail and how it can be implemented to create a stylish checkbox design.

## Key Features of the HTML Stylish Checkbox Design

The HTML stylish checkbox design offers various customizations, including the [HTML tick icon](https://layakcoder.com/tick-mark/), an appealing hover effect, and smooth animations. Below is the breakdown of the features included in the [HTML tick mark code](https://layakcoder.com/tick-mark/).

### 1\. Clean and Modern Look

Using the **HTML tick mark** design, the checkbox is given a modern touch with a circular background and sleek transitions. By incorporating a [**HTML tick character**](https://layakcoder.com/tick-mark/) into the design, you add a visually appealing element that makes the checkbox stand out.

### 2\. Interactive Tick Mark Behavior

The checkbox interacts with the user in a delightful way. When checked, the checkbox not only changes its color but also animates the appearance of the tick mark. The **HTML tick symbol** appears smoothly and dynamically, creating an engaging user experience.

### 3\. Hover and Active States

Adding hover and active states gives your checkbox a more refined appearance. On hover, the checkbox shrinks slightly and changes color, signaling to the user that it is interactive. When the user clicks the checkbox, it activates and scales down for a more interactive feel.

## The HTML Structure for the Checkbox

Let's dive into the HTML structure required to implement the stylish checkbox with an [HTML tick mark code](https://layakcoder.com/tick-mark/).

```xml
htmlCopy code<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>Check Box || layakcoder</title>
</head>
<body>
    <input type="checkbox" id="_checkbox">
    <label for="_checkbox">
      <div id="tick_mark"></div>
    </label>
</body>
</html>
```

### HTML Elements in the Code

* The `input` tag is used to create the checkbox itself. The `id="_checkbox"` allows us to reference this checkbox in CSS for customization.
    
* The `label` tag is associated with the checkbox using the `for` attribute. This is a crucial step to enhance accessibility and functionality.
    
* The `div` with the ID `tick_mark` is where the [**HTML tick icon**](https://layakcoder.com/tick-mark/) is placed. It is positioned inside the label and will appear once the checkbox is checked.
    

## The CSS for Styling and Animation

The CSS code is responsible for transforming the checkbox into a stylish and interactive element. It provides the layout, colors, and transitions that bring the checkbox to life. Here's the full CSS:

```css
cssCopy code* {
    -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent;
    outline: none;
}

html,
body {
    height: 100%;
    background-color: black;
}

body {
    margin: 0;
}

#_checkbox {
    display: none;
}

label {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    right: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    background-color: #5e2cd3;
    transform: translateY(-50%);
    border-radius: 50%;
    box-shadow: 0 7px 10px #bdb8ff;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: 0.2s ease transform, 0.2s ease background-color,
      0.2s ease box-shadow;
    overflow: hidden;
    z-index: 1;
}

label:before {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    right: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 70px;
    height: 70px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    background-color: #fff;
    transform: translateY(-50%);
    border-radius: 50%;
    box-shadow: inset 0 7px 10px #bfb8ff;
    transition: 0.2s ease width, 0.2s ease height;
}

label:hover:before {
    width: 55px;
    height: 55px;
    box-shadow: inset 0 7px 10px #96a9ff;
}

label:active {
    transform: translateY(-50%) scale(0.9);
}

#tick_mark {
    position: absolute;
    top: -1px;
    right: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 60px;
    height: 60px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    margin-left: 14px;
    transform: rotateZ(-40deg);
}

#tick_mark:before,
#tick_mark:after {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    background-color: #fff;
    border-radius: 2px;
    opacity: 0;
    transition: 0.2s ease transform, 0.2s ease opacity;
}

#tick_mark:before {
    left: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    width: 10px;
    height: 30px;
    box-shadow: -2px 0 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23);
    transform: translateY(-68px);
}

#tick_mark:after {
    left: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 10px;
    box-shadow: 0 3px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.23);
    transform: translateX(78px);
}

#_checkbox:checked + label {
    background-color: #07d410;
    box-shadow: 0 7px 10px #92ff97;
}

#_checkbox:checked + label:before {
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
}

#_checkbox:checked + label #tick_mark:before,
#_checkbox:checked + label #tick_mark:after {
    transform: translate(0);
    opacity: 1;
}
```

### CSS Breakdown

* The `#_checkbox` is hidden with `display: none`, allowing us to customize the visible checkbox with the label.
    
* The `label` element is styled to create a circular checkbox. It uses `border-radius` to make it round and adds shadows for a more polished appearance.
    
* The `tick_mark` div inside the label is initially invisible. It becomes visible with a smooth transition when the checkbox is checked, displaying the **HTML tick mark** inside the checkbox.
    
* Transitions and hover effects are added to make the interaction smoother, enhancing the user experience.
    

## How the HTML Tick Mark Appears

The **HTML tick mark** is visually represented by two `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements in the CSS. These elements are positioned to form the distinct checkmark shape when the checkbox is checked. The [**HTML tick character**](https://layakcoder.com/tick-mark/) becomes visible after the checkbox is selected, providing immediate feedback to the user.
