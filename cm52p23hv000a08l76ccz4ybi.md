The [star rating system](https://layakcoder.com/star-rating-system/) has become a standard for collecting user feedback, and when combined with animation, it creates a more engaging and dynamic experience. In this article, we will dive deep into building a star rating system using CSS and HTML, focusing on the [**star rating animation CSS**](https://layakcoder.com/star-rating-animation-css/) to provide a smooth visual feedback loop.

## What is a Star Rating Animation CSS?

A [**star rating animation CSS**](https://layakcoder.com/star-rating-animation-css/) component is a dynamic element used in web applications to allow users to rate a product, service, or content. It typically consists of five stars, with each star representing a point on a scale of 1 to 5. The animation part comes in when a user interacts with the stars, typically by clicking or hovering over them, resulting in a smooth transition or effect.

### Why Use a Star Rating System?

A [**star rating system**](https://layakcoder.com/star-rating-system/) serves as a simple yet effective way to measure user satisfaction. By allowing users to rate something, you get valuable feedback on the performance or quality of your product or service. The [star rating system](https://layakcoder.com/star-rating-system/) is intuitive and easy to understand, making it a go-to choice for websites ranging from eCommerce platforms to blogs and movie review sites.

Moreover, integrating **CSS star animation** into the rating system can make the interaction much more fun and engaging. When combined with **star animation CSS**, this component not only looks visually appealing but also feels responsive to user input.

## Creating a Five Star Rating Animation Using CSS and HTML

### HTML Structure for the Star Rating System

Let's start by setting up the HTML structure for the [**five star rating**](https://layakcoder.com/five-star-rating/) component. We'll need radio buttons for each star, which will allow users to select their rating. Additionally, each star will be associated with an SVG to represent the rating visually.

```xml
htmlCopy code<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <title>Five Star Rating Animation</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="feedback">
            <div class="rating">
                <input type="radio" name="rating" id="rating-5">
                <label for="rating-5"></label>
                <input type="radio" name="rating" id="rating-4">
                <label for="rating-4"></label>
                <input type="radio" name="rating" id="rating-3">
                <label for="rating-3"></label>
                <input type="radio" name="rating" id="rating-2">
                <label for="rating-2"></label>
                <input type="radio" name="rating" id="rating-1">
                <label for="rating-1"></label>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### Adding CSS for the Star Rating Animation

Now that we have the HTML structure, we can move on to the CSS for styling and animating the stars. The goal here is to ensure that the stars fill up with color when selected, and we will use **star animation CSS** to animate this change smoothly.

```css
* Basic styling */
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    background-color: #f4f4f4;
}

.container {
    text-align: center;
}

.rating {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    position: relative;
}

input[type="radio"] {
    display: none;
}

label {
    font-size: 50px;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}

/* Star Rating Animation */
input[type="radio"]:checked ~ label {
    color: #ffd93b; /* Golden color */
}

input[type="radio"]:hover ~ label {
    transform: scale(1.2);
    transition: transform 0.2s ease;
}

input[type="radio"]:checked {
    transform: scale(1.5);
}
```

### Explanation of the CSS

In this CSS, we used the `input[type="radio"]` elements to handle the userâ€™s selection. We hid the radio buttons but kept their functionality. The labels, which represent the stars, are styled with large font sizes and golden color when selected.

* The **star animation CSS** is achieved by using the `:checked` selector, which allows us to change the appearance of the stars when a user clicks on them.
    
* The hover effect (`transform: scale(1.2)`) is added to make the stars grow slightly when the user hovers over them, providing immediate feedback.
    

### The Role of CSS Transitions

CSS transitions are key in providing smooth animation effects. The transition on the stars (`transform 0.3s ease`) makes the scale animation smooth and pleasant, while `color` changes when a radio button is checked give the stars a glowing, animated effect. The combination of both helps make the [**star rating system**](https://layakcoder.com/star-rating-system/) interactive and visually appealing.

### Enhancing with JavaScript

For more advanced functionality, such as updating a rating dynamically or saving the feedback, JavaScript can be incorporated. However, for a basic [**five star rating**](https://layakcoder.com/five-star-rating/) **animation**, HTML and CSS are sufficient.

```javascript
const stars = document.querySelectorAll('.rating input');
stars.forEach(star => {
    star.addEventListener('change', function () {
        alert(`You have selected a rating of ${this.id.split('-')[1]} stars.`);
    });
});
```

This simple script triggers an alert when a user selects a rating, displaying their rating choice.
