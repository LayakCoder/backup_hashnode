## Dynamic Star Rating Animation CSS: How It Works

### **Core Elements of a Star Rating System**

To create a functional [**five star rating**](https://layakcoder.com/five-star-rating/) **system**, the core components are:

* **Input Elements**: Radio buttons for user selection.
    
* **CSS Styling**: For star shapes and animations.
    
* **JavaScript (Optional)**: To capture user input or add interactivity.
    

Here's an example structure for a dynamic [star rating system](https://layakcoder.com/star-rating-system/):

```xml
<div class="container">
  <div class="rating">
    <input type="radio" name="rating" id="rating-5">
    <label for="rating-5"></label>
    <input type="radio" name="rating" id="rating-4">
    <label for="rating-4"></label>
    <input type="radio" name="rating" id="rating-3">
    <label for="rating-3"></label>
    <input type="radio" name="rating" id="rating-2">
    <label for="rating-2"></label>
    <input type="radio" name="rating" id="rating-1">
    <label for="rating-1"></label>
    <div class="emoji-wrapper">
      <div class="emoji"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

```

This code sets up the HTML structure for a [star rating system](https://layakcoder.com/star-rating-system/). Each star is represented by a radio button, and the corresponding label becomes the clickable star.

### **Animating Star Ratings with CSS**

CSS is where the magic happens. Here's an example of **star animation CSS** that animates stars when hovered:

```css
.rating input[type="radio"]:checked ~ label {
  color: gold;
  transform: scale(1.2);
  transition: transform 0.2s ease-in-out;
}
```

In this snippet:

* `:checked ~ label` targets the label corresponding to the selected star.
    
* `transform: scale(1.2)` enlarges the star for emphasis.
    
* `transition` smoothens the animation.
