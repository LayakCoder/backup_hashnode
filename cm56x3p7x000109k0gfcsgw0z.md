Incorporating a well-designed [footer using HTML and CSS](https://layakcoder.com/footer/) enhances the website's usability and accessibility, helping users find essential footer content easily.

## Basics of a Footer in HTML and CSS

Creating a [footer using HTML and CSS](https://layakcoder.com/footer/) requires some basic knowledge of both languages. Let’s start with understanding the structure and styling.

### HTML Structure for the Footer

The HTML structure for the footer is simple. We define the `<footer>` tag, which contains different sections, such as the company info, help, online shop, and social media links. Here’s a basic example of a footer in HTML:

```xml
<footer class="footer">
   <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
         <div class="footer-col">
            <h4>Company</h4>
            <ul>
               <li><a href="#">About Us</a></li>
               <li><a href="#">Our Services</a></li>
               <li><a href="#">Privacy Policy</a></li>
               <li><a href="#">Affiliate Program</a></li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <div class="footer-col">
            <h4>Get Help</h4>
            <ul>
               <li><a href="#">FAQ</a></li>
               <li><a href="#">Shipping</a></li>
               <li><a href="#">Returns</a></li>
               <li><a href="#">Order Status</a></li>
               <li><a href="#">Payment Options</a></li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <div class="footer-col">
            <h4>Online Shop</h4>
            <ul>
               <li><a href="#">Watches</a></li>
               <li><a href="#">Bags</a></li>
               <li><a href="#">Shoes</a></li>
               <li><a href="#">Dresses</a></li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <div class="footer-col">
            <h4>Follow Us</h4>
            <div class="social-links">
               <a href="#"><i class="fab fa-facebook-f"></i></a>
               <a href="#"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a>
               <a href="#"><i class="fab fa-instagram"></i></a>
               <a href="#"><i class="fab fa-linkedin-in"></i></a>
            </div>
         </div>
      </div>
   </div>
</footer>
```

This simple HTML structure lays out four columns: **Company**, **Get Help**, **Online Shop**, and **Follow Us**, each with its list of links.

### CSS Styling for the Footer

For styling, we need to make the footer responsive. This involves defining the layout and ensuring it adapts to different screen sizes. The following CSS will style the footer and its content:

```css
body {
   line-height: 1.5;
   font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
}

.container {
   max-width: 1170px;
   margin: auto;
}

.row {
   display: flex;
   flex-wrap: wrap;
}

ul {
   list-style: none;
}

.footer {
   background-color: #24262b;
   padding: 70px 0;
}

.footer-col {
   width: 25%;
   padding: 0 15px;
}

.footer-col h4 {
   font-size: 18px;
   color: #ffffff;
   text-transform: capitalize;
   margin-bottom: 35px;
   font-weight: 500;
   position: relative;
}

.footer-col h4::before {
   content: '';
   position: absolute;
   left: 0;
   bottom: -10px;
   background-color: #e91e63;
   height: 2px;
   width: 50px;
}

.footer-col ul li a {
   font-size: 16px;
   color: #bbbbbb;
   text-decoration: none;
   display: block;
   transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.footer-col ul li a:hover {
   color: #ffffff;
   padding-left: 8px;
}

.footer-col .social-links a {
   display: inline-block;
   height: 40px;
   width: 40px;
   background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
   margin: 0 10px 10px 0;
   text-align: center;
   line-height: 40px;
   border-radius: 50%;
   color: #ffffff;
   transition: all 0.5s ease;
}

.footer-col .social-links a:hover {
   color: #24262b;
   background-color: #ffffff;
}

/* Responsive Styles */
@media (max-width: 767px) {
   .footer-col {
      width: 50%;
      margin-bottom: 30px;
   }
}

@media (max-width: 574px) {
   .footer-col {
      width: 100%;
   }
}
```

This CSS code ensures that the footer adjusts its layout depending on the device screen size, making it responsive. The footer is styled with a dark background and contrasting text colors for readability.

### Ensuring Responsiveness

One of the most crucial aspects of modern web design is ensuring that the footer behaves responsively. In the provided CSS, the media queries make sure that as the screen size decreases, the footer columns adjust to fit smaller devices.

* For screens wider than 767px, the footer has four equal-width columns.
    
* Between 574px and 767px, the columns adjust to two per row.
    
* For screens smaller than 574px, each column takes up the full width, stacking vertically.
    

This flexibility ensures that the footer looks great on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops alike.

* **Include essential links**: Ensure that important pages, such as the privacy policy, terms of service, and contact info, are easily accessible.
    
* **Social media integration**: Social media icons should be visible but not overwhelming, as they help users connect with your brand.
